# EP Ops dashboard — handoff for Claude Code

Read this first. It is the brief, the state of play, and the backlog for the ops dashboard at `/ops`.
Design reference (Claude Design canvas, owner: Jacob): https://claude.ai/code/artifact/7dade985-636f-4619-a566-0314f4ea3ee7
— boards: System, Components, Today, Events, Publish, Teacher (phone), Business, Settings, People, Time clock.

## 1. What the dashboard is for

One place for EP staff, contractors and rotating teachers. Every screen answers one question:

| Place | Question | Who |
|---|---|---|
| Today `/ops` | What needs me this week? | everyone (scoped) |
| Events `/ops/events` | Is each offering ready? | everyone; editors change |
| Tasks `/ops/tasks` | The whole task list | staff |
| Publish `/ops/content` | Is everything we publish moving? | staff |
| Business `/ops/insights` | Is EP healthy? | director |
| People `/ops/team`, Hours `/ops/hours` | Who does what; time worked | staff |
| Settings `/ops/settings` | Every sheet-backed table | director + editors (manager, projects) |

## 2. State of play (Oct 2026)

Merged to `main`:
- PR #5 Phase 1 restyle (design system in `app/ops/ops.css`, sidebar shell)
- PR #6 Phase 2 regroup (Tasks, Settings, Triage on Today, Review in Publish) + task store

On a branch, awaiting merge: `ops-time-clock` (time clock with monthly caps). Merge it before starting new work.

Production facts:
- Vercel project `ep-website-beta` (Jacob's account), repo `embodiedphilosophy/ep-website`.
- Tasks now live in Neon Postgres (`DATABASE_URL`). 76 tasks were imported from Motion. `TASKS_BACKEND` is removed, so the database is the source of truth.
- Motion is now only Jacob's read-only overview: the daily job adds one "EP Ops · <date>" task to his Motion each morning (`lib/ops/motiondigest.js`).
- Monthly hour caps: Team tab column `monthly_hours` (Settings → Team).

## 3. Architecture map

- `app/ops/Shell.js` sidebar + page header (`title`, `eyebrow`, `head`). `lib/ops/nav.js` who sees which item.
- `app/ops/ops.css` the design system. Scoped to `.ops-shell` (and `.ops-login`) because `/teach` reuses `ops-*` class names. Old ops rules in `app/globals.css` are overridden, not yet deleted.
- Tasks: always import from `lib/ops/taskstore.js` (never `motion.js` or `taskdb.js` directly). Shape: `{ id, name, description, due, labels[], completed, blockedOn, auto }`. Owners are labels (a person's name or a role). Conventions kept in `description`: `[ep:EVENTID:task-slug:owner-slug]` event tag, `[blocked:Name]`, `[auto:date:rule]`.
- `lib/ops/tasks.js` task logic (expected tasks from Task Templates, `visibleTo`, `forHome`, `bucket`, `groupByEvent`, `needsOwner`). `syncToMotion()` is a legacy name; it writes to the task store.
- `lib/ops/hours.js` time clock (Neon tables `ops_shifts`, `ops_hour_requests`, `ops_hour_alerts`; made on first use).
- `lib/ops/store.js` the only safe writer to the calendar sheet (by header name, refuses formula columns, conflict check, Change Log). Use it for any sheet write.
- `lib/ops/sitetables.js` + `app/ops/content/SiteEditor.js` the table editor behind Settings (`scope="settings"`).
- `lib/ops/checks.js` + `lib/ops/readiness.js` event readiness checks.
- Crons (`vercel.json`): `/api/ops/daily` 13:00 UTC (task sync, reminders, nudges, Motion digest), `/api/ops/auto` every 15 min (auto-complete, shift sweep).
- Root `ops/` folder (`ops/motion.js`, `ops/tasks.js`) is an old copy, not imported by the app. Confirm and delete.

## 4. Rules (keep these)

- The Google Sheet (EP-Programming-Calendar) is the source of truth for events and settings; the database holds tasks, hours and decisions. Never keep a second checklist.
- Design: terra `--risk` only for late/at risk; pine `--pine` for actions; status is always a dot + a word; 44px rows; one section-header style; underline tabs; detail in a drawer; help text sparingly. No emoji, no new fonts, no gradients.
- Dates are New York time (`todayET()`; `America/New_York` client-side).
- Teacher reminder emails go only to the addresses in that session's Teacher/Host Emails column. Never widen this.
- Automated emails go from "EP Admin" <team@embodiedphilosophy.com>.
- Copy: plain, short, sentence case. Name things the user knows (Master Schedule, Kit, Circle).
- Next.js here is a new major version: check `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before using unfamiliar APIs.

## 5. Backlog (do in this order; one branch + PR each)

Each item: build passes (`npm run build`), works at phone width, follows section 4.

1. **Waiting on your yes (Today, director, top of main column).** One list, oldest first, each with one button:
   extra-hours requests (`pendingRequests()` in `lib/ops/hours.js`; move them out of the Team hours aside),
   social posts awaiting approval (Social Engine status `Proposed` within the next 7 days → link to Publish → Social),
   teacher bios / course pages with status `submitted` (Publish → Review),
   Ad Agent recommendations when the Ad Agent is in recommend-only mode (read from the Revenue & Metrics sheet, see `lib/ops/metrics.js` ad sets `action`; read-only: link out, don't act).
   Skip Circle cancellations for now (no data source yet) and note it in the PR.
2. **Repeating tasks.** New Settings table "Recurring tasks" (sheet tab: `task`, `owner`, `every` = weekly|monthly, `day` = weekday name or day of month, `active`). The daily job creates the next occurrence once, de-duplicated by a `[rec:<slug>:<date>]` tag in the description. Examples to seed (as rows, not code): weekly social approval (Sat, Rebecka), monthly close (1st, Jacob).
3. **Publish → Overview tab** (design board "Publish"): one row per lane (Social, Email, Media, Site copy) with status + next action, next 9 posts strip, promo emails by event, review count. Make it the default tab. Data already exists in `app/ops/content/page.js` (promoRows, waitingReplays, upcomingSocial).
4. **Enrolments on Events.** Investigate first (`lib/circle.js`, `lib/kit.js`, `lib/membersync.js`): signups per event (Kit enrolled tag count is the likely source), and "paid but not in Circle" for Circle offerings. Show an Enrolled column + bar in the events list and a block at the top of the drawer (design board "Events"). If a source isn't reachable, ship what is and note the gap.
5. **Funnel on Business** (design board "Business"): Practice Report quiz → Meditation Mondays → Wisdom School → Plus → Sādhana School, last 30 days / quarter / year. Investigate the quiz data source (report.embodiedphilosophy.com, likely Kit tags/forms). Placeholders are not acceptable in production: if a step has no source, hide it and say so in the PR.
6. **Support queue** (Ether → Ichha handoffs). Ether is a separate project, not in this repo. Only if handoffs are reachable (API or shared DB) add a Support section to Today (Ichha first, director count). Otherwise skip and write down what's needed.
7. **Cleanup.** Delete ops rules in `app/globals.css` now superseded by `ops.css` (check `/teach` still renders); delete root `ops/` if unused; rename `syncToMotion` → `syncTasks`; move Social libraries (quotes, images, captions, rules, categories, sources) from Publish → Social into Settings if it can be done without breaking `SocialEngine.js`.

## 6. Verifying without a login

There are no tests. Pages need a signed-in user and live sheets. To check a layout: add a throwaway route (e.g. `app/ops-preview/page.js`) that renders the components with sample props inside `<div className="ops-root">`, run `npx next dev`, screenshot with Playwright, then delete the route before committing. Never commit the preview route.

## 7. Open decisions (defaults if nobody answers)

- Weekly hour limits: not needed; monthly only.
- Staff see only their own tasks (plus anything waiting on them); directors see all.
- Personal/Oxford tasks stay in Jacob's own Motion; they are never imported.
- Circle cancellation handling (remove + Kit win-back tag): later, needs a source.
